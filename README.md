What it does
Randomly Generates a maze provided starting coordinates and a number of tunnels. The player is set to survival mode and given 64 torches. The objective is to reach the chest to uncover the prize.

How to Use
1) Install Minecraft Server (I use PaperMC)
2) Set Path in options.txt to Minecraft Server installation directory
3) Use start.command to Start the Minecraft Server Server

The Maze is created by fill air commands with a dirt block around the boundary of the tunnels, here it is inverted for illustration purposes.
